This code is for the website located at http://tinyurl.com/mapTwittsburgh.  Development is in the initial stages.

The data used can be found in penn3.js - it is a combination of popular (using tf-idf weighting) unigrams from Twitter data collected from the Gardenhose from early 2013 within Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas, and demographic/neighborhood data from <a href="http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/snap/">Pittsburgh SNAP</a>. 

brandon_re.tff is a custom font built by Robyn Hammond.  

We also use local copies of leaflet.css and leaflet.js  -these local copies should be removed in future work.
